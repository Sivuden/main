	4	+	Steampunk-ish mod in development. Current Devs Tehwolfgang, Sivvolf. 
	5	+	
	6	+	This mod will be focused around fluid flow and mechanical manipulation (Mechanical force, Hydraulics, wind flow, and such). 
	7	+	This mechanical force will drive structures of all kinds and purposes for a large-scale automation/production process focused on
	8	+	large batches of materials being processed slowly in parallel as opposed to most mods serial, quick processing. 
	9	+	
	10	+	
	11	+	Many aspects of the mod will focus on basic automation of mechanical constructs -mobile and stationary - through the use
	12	+	of multiblock structures configured with internal, specially crafted 'modules'. These modules will each contain bits and pieces that
	13	+	allow the construct to do various things; for instance a mobility block allowing 1 meter of movement every five ticks, or a
	14	+	block-breaking module which allows the construct to break blocks placed in its path before moving fowards. 
	15	+	
	16	+	These constructs will be powered via mechanical means, such as basic multiblocks like watermills, windmills, 
	17	+	thermal energy (I.e. stirling engines or solar plants), pressure differentials (i.e. Dams or spacial/dimensional vacuums),
	18	+	and more unrenewable sources such as thermal differentials via. burning coal or other hot materials. 
	19	+	
	20	+	This power will be able to be used to power machines such as large-scale multiblock ore processors (capable of slowly
	21	+	curshing large quantities of ore in parallel), Grinders, and other refining machines that increase ore yield. 
	22	+	Additional machines include autonomous drones (multiblock structures that perform functions based on their design + components),
	23	+	packaging/condensing machines that increase storage density of normal items, High-pressure tanks and valve systems
	24	+	that allow complex liquid storeage and routing (especially high-quantity liquid transport). 
	25	+	
	26	+	
	27	+	Pressurised liquids: Liquid can be pressurised into denser forms and stored in special multiblock tanks, requiring some power
	28	+	and acting as deep storage for liquids (or high-volume transport). Stronger materials can handle higher pressures!
